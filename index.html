							<h3>Kim Bouris</h3>
							<p>Kim is Christy's younger sister. Younger, but taller, sister. Christy and Kim enjoy many things together: eating olives, sleeping on car trips, interpretive dancing, cribbage games, and eating olives. She will smile (and probably make a funny face) when she looks over her shoulder in August and sees Kim standing behind her, maid of honoring like a champ.</p>

							<h3>Amy Oxendale</h3>
							<p>Almost five years ago, Amy and Christy were set up on a kind of blind (roommate) date at seminary. Their propensity for broadway singing and overly exact picture hanging escapades made for delightful apartment living. Christy is thankful that they continue to share life together in the neighborhood.</p>
