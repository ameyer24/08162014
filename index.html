							<h3>Kim Bouris</h3>
							<p>Kim is Christy's younger sister. Younger, but taller, sister. Christy and Kim enjoy many things together: eating olives, sleeping on car trips, interpretive dancing, cribbage games, and eating olives. She will smile (and probably make a funny face) when she looks over her shoulder in August and sees Kim standing behind her, maid of honoring like a champ.</p>

							<h3>Amy Oxendale</h3>
							<p>Almost five years ago, Amy and Christy were set up on a kind of blind (roommate) date at seminary. Their propensity for broadway singing and overly exact picture hanging escapades made for delightful apartment living. Christy is thankful that they continue to share life together in the neighborhood.</p>

							<h3>Diana Pooley</h3>
							<p>Almost fifteen (!) years ago, Christy and Diana met on the campus of Bates College amidst the colors of fall in Maine. Many of Christy's college escapades included Diana. Christy smiles when she remembers all that they have and will continue to share which includes, but isn't limited to: dorm life, long conversations, apricot paste, deep thinking, ministry, and a love of middle eastern food.</p>

							<h3>Elise Steel</h3>
							<p>Christy remembers meeting Elise during her first week of seminary in Chicago. They made a quick coastal connection (east coast meets west!) over the awkwardness that is learning the biblical Greek language. Adventures with Elise have included a Halloween as Thema & Louise, road tripping from MA to IL by way of The Pizza Shop, and introducing Christy to Mary Oliver. Elise has a great way of living as a "cheerleader" for her friends, and Christy is glad that Elise has been in the stands rooting for her along the way.</p>

							<h3>Christina Tinglof</h3>
							<p>Christina and Christy met when they were both in youth ministry in Massachusetts. Christy owes her a debt of gratitude for an overdue introduction to the beauty that was the television series My So Called Life. Beyond this enriching gift, Christina has been the giver of many gifts - Christy's first Covenant Book of Worship, refreshing phone calls, fostering a love of Lauryn Hill, and many many many gchats.</p>
